    - POD corrections
    -

0.06    2022-03-20
    - Made "API CACHE METHODS" section a head1 in POD

0.05    2022-03-20
    - DEBUG_API_CACHE now retrieved from $ENV{DEBUG_TESLA_API_CACHE} instead of
      having it as a magic number (so we don't accidentally publish the code
      with it set ;)
    - Make EXAMPLE POD section a head1; accidentally had it as a head2
    - Moved all cache methods in POD to their own METHOD section

0.04    2022-03-20
    - Fix issue where we were assigning to the wrong variable in
      api_cache_time()
    - Renamed $api_cache_time to $api_cache_alive_time to be non-ambiguous to
      the api_cache_time() method
    - Added api_cache_persist() and api_cache_persist param. Allows temporarily
      or permanently returning the cached Tesla API data
    - Added entire section in POD dealing exclusively with the API caching
      mechanism

0.03    2022-03-19
    - Added api_clear_cache() for methods that need to daisy chain calls, but
      require fresh data between them
    - Added ability to send in an additional param, $api_params to api(), so
      that we can send them to the API as JSON body content
      (eg. $vehicle->trunk_actuate with 'which_trunk' => 'rear');

0.02    2022-03-18
    - Removed all vehicle related stuff and moved it into a separate subclass
      distribution, Tesla::Vehicle. This distribution will only be for the
      managing of access tokens and speaking to the Tesla API directly
    - Cleaned up documentation about "id" param in new(). The children
      classes must take care of this
    - Added full blown caching mechanism to cache endpoint/id pair data for
      each call through the Tesla API (closes #3)
    - Access tokens now track their own expiry, and auto-refresh when needed
      (closes #2)

0.01    2022-03-16
    - Auto generated distribution with Dist::Mgr
    - Prompt user to authenticate via URL, and to paste new URL back into
      console
    - Auto generate access token, and stash home directory cache
    - Impemented api(), which will use endpoints() for all Tesla API calls
    - Implemented rudimentary vehicle ID handling
    - Implemented initial basic list of API functionality
    - Tesla API endpoints are stored in __DATA__ for the time being
