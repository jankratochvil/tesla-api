Revision history for Tesla-API

0.02 UNREL
    - Removed all vehicle related stuff and moved it into a separate subclass
      distribution, Tesla::Vehicle. This distribution will only be for the
      managing of access tokens and speaking to the Tesla API directly
    - Cleaned up documentation about "id" param in new(). The children
      classes must take care of this
    - Added full blown caching mechanism to cache endpoint/id pair data for
      each call through the Tesla API (closes #3)
    - Access tokens now track their own expiry, and auto-refresh when needed
      (closes #2)
